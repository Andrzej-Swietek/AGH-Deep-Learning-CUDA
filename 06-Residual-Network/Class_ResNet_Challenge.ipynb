You've seen that smaller batch sizes add noise to the optimization process, which can help with avoiding getting trapped in local minima or slowed down at a saddle point. A smaller batch size will also mean running back-propagation and updating the gradients more times per epoch (taking more steps).\n",

Good performance of a model on the dataset does not indicate that the model will perform well on a more complicated set of images.\n",

The WideResNet-16-10 we will use below can achieve with O(10 million) parameters accuracy that is competitive with much deeper networks with more parameters."
